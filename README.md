# discord-username-update-self

This selfbot will update the notes on a user if they change their username with the user's previous username.



#Installation:

Install NodeJS and NPM

Install Discord.js (The Latest stable version has a bug with user.setNote so this script does not use the library's method.)

Start this script with your token as the first argument and your ID as the second. (Your ID is needed for the stop command)



To stop the script send the message "uu stop" in any Discord channel.
